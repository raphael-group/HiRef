# Hierarchical Refinement (HiRef)

This is the repository for the paper "Hierarchical Refinement: Optimal Transport to Infinity and Beyond," which scales optimal transport linearly in space and log-linearly in time.

*Figure 1: Hierarchical Refinement algorithm: low-rank optimal transport is used to progressively refine partitions at the previous scale, with the coarsest scale partitions denoted $X^{(1)}, Y^{(1)}$, and the finest scale partitions $X^{(\kappa)}, Y^{(\kappa)}$ corresponding to the individual points in the datasets.*
